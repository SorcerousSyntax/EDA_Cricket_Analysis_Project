# 🏏 EDA Project: Cricket Analysis

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on cricket data! This project dives deep into historical cricket data to uncover insights about player performances, match trends, and season-wise statistics using Python-based visualization and analysis tools.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is aimed at understanding the patterns and behaviors within a cricket dataset by applying various EDA techniques. With the help of powerful Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, we extract, clean, and analyze the data to answer key cricket-related questions.
